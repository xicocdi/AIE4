QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-12\\nTitle: Exploring Fact Memorization and Style Imitation in LLMs Using QLoRA: An Experimental Study and Quality Assessment Methods\\nAuthors: Eugene Vyborov, Oleksiy Osypenko, Serge Sotnyk\\nSummary: There are various methods for adapting LLMs to different domains.

              "'RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to improve the performance of language models by combining retrieval-based methods with generative models. Here‚Äôs a brief overview of how it works:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval**: In the first step, the system retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus or database. This is typically done using a retrieval model, such as BM25 or a dense retrieval model like DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval).\\n\\n2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved documents are then used to augment the input to the generative model. This means that the generative model has access to additional context or information that can help it produce more accurate and relevant responses.\\n\\n3. **Generation**: Finally, the generative model, such as GPT-3 or BERT, uses the augmented input to generate a response. The additional context provided by the retrieved documents helps the model generate more informed and contextually appropriate responses.\\n\\nRAG is particularly useful in scenarios where the generative model might not have enough information to produce a high-quality response on its own. By leveraging external knowledge through retrieval, RAG can significantly enhance the performance of language models in tasks such as question answering, dialogue systems, and more.'"

              "   'output': \"LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is a technique used in machine learning, particularly in the context of fine-tuning large pre-trained models. Here are some significant improvements and benefits that LoRA provides:\\n\\n1. **Parameter Efficiency**: LoRA allows for fine-tuning large models with a significantly smaller number of parameters. This reduces the computational resources and memory required for training and inference.\\n\\n2. **Reduced Overfitting**: By adapting only a low-rank subset of the model's parameters, LoRA helps in reducing the risk of overfitting, especially when dealing with smaller datasets.\\n\\n3. **Faster Training**: Due to the reduced number of parameters that need to be updated, training times are generally faster compared to traditional fine-tuning methods.\\n\\n4. **Modularity**: LoRA enables modular updates to the model. This means that different tasks can have their own low-rank adaptations, which can be combined or swapped as needed without retraining the entire model.\\n\\n5. **Scalability**: LoRA is particularly useful for very large models where full fine-tuning would be computationally prohibitive. It scales well with the size of the model.\\n\\n6. **Improved Generalization**: By focusing on low-rank adaptations, LoRA can help the model generalize better to new tasks or domains, leveraging the pre-trained knowledge more effectively.\\n\\n7. **Resource Efficiency**: LoRA makes it feasible to deploy large models on resource-constrained environments, such as edge devices, by reducing the memory footprint and computational requirements.\\n\\nThese improvements make LoRA a valuable technique for efficiently fine-tuning large pre-trained models, making them more accessible and practical for a wide range of applications.\",\n",

              "   'output': \"A Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system is a type of artificial intelligence model that combines retrieval-based and generation-based approaches to improve the quality and relevance of generated responses. Here's a breakdown of the two components:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval-Based Component**: This part of the system retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus or database based on the input query. It uses techniques from information retrieval to find the most relevant content that can help answer the query.\\n\\n2. **Generation-Based Component**: This part of the system uses a generative model, such as a transformer-based language model (e.g., GPT-3), to generate a coherent and contextually appropriate response. The generative model can create new text based on the input query and the retrieved documents.\\n\\n### How RAG Works:\\n1. **Query Input**: The system receives a query or question from the user.\\n2. **Document Retrieval**: The retrieval component searches a large corpus to find documents or passages that are relevant to the query.\\n3. **Response Generation**: The generative model takes the retrieved documents and the original query as input to generate a response. The retrieved documents provide context and factual information that the generative model can use to produce a more accurate and informative answer.\\n\\n### Benefits of RAG:\\n- **Improved Accuracy**: By leveraging relevant documents, the system can provide more accurate and contextually appropriate responses.\\n- **Enhanced Knowledge**: The system can access a vast amount of information, making it more knowledgeable and capable of answering a wide range of questions.\\n- **Contextual Relevance**: The retrieval component ensures that the generated responses are grounded in real, relevant information, reducing the likelihood of generating incorrect or nonsensical answers.\\n\\n### Applications:\\n- **Question Answering Systems**: RAG can be used to build advanced QA systems that provide precise answers to user queries.\\n- **Customer Support**: It can enhance customer support chatbots by providing accurate and contextually relevant responses.\\n- **Content Creation**: RAG can assist in generating content that is well-informed and based on existing knowledge.\\n\\nOverall, Retrieval Augmented Generation systems represent a powerful approach to combining the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based models to create more effective and reliable AI systems.\",\n",
